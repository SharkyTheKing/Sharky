# Sharky
Random cogs that I've been making, overall just for learning or for myself.

## Announcements
This cog is purely for announcements made from Moderators/Admins of a Discord. It'll allow you to make announcements either in a specific channel or if no channel is given it'll use the channel you're in.

You have three commands
- Alert: Is the announcement feature, you can give a channel to direct to and a role so it'll mention it in the announcement.
- Messageedit: This does what it's called, edits a message by the bot.
- Mentionable: This looks at the given role, makes it mentionable if it's not already and unmentionable if it's not already.

## Charlimit
This cog was made to limit the amount of characters people send in a channel. You can limit it however many characters you want. It'll only check in the channel that's given in the config to count the characters that's been sent.

You also have the option to make the bot send a message to notify the user that their mesasge in X channel has exceed X character limit, this is useful for people who are curious to know what the limit is and are wondering why their message was removed.

There are a few commands in to lock a channel by itself, still working on this overall to make it better.

## Verify
This cog is a verification process. Where it'll automactically add someone to a muted role and will get them to type into a specific channel the accept command to make sure they agree to your rules before being able to see the entire server.

Currently you must give the proper role to add and setup the permissions yourself. You will also need to toggle the feature on or else it won't work.

## Other
The rest of the cogs are random stuff I've coded and been toying with on and off, decided to keep on the repo incase I ever want to dig more into a full functionality or if someone wants to toy with it.
